## Calendar and Pantheon

There are 308 days in a year in Orwithen, with four elevendays per month (7 months per year). The days of the week are simply the number, e.g. "Weekday 5".

The Months are named after the pantheon of good and unaligned gods:

- [[Reuliel]]
- [[Hoeliel]]
- [[Maha]]
- [[Zepha]]
- [[Camue]]
- [[Zaban]]
- [[Althah]]

The two winter months belong to Reuliel and Hoeliel, as after their twin nature. Maha and Althah share spring and autumn respectively, with the summer months dedicated to Zepha, Camue, and Zaban. The prosperity of a thriving city is often noted by the presence of three temples to the summer gods.
The forgotten month of [[Artin]] used to be the third month of winter, offering a perfect symmetry back before the [[Calamity]]. Years are denoted with the PC suffix, for Post-Calamity.
