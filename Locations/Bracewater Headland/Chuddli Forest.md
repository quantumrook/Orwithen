The Chuddli Forest is a relatively new, on the order of centuries, forest to the [[Bracewater Headland]] region. Once the [[Bade Desert]] spanned the whole land mass, but it has been shrinking due to the growth of vegetation on the headland. Old stories tell of a rainbow colored orb that supposedly lies in the heart of the forest and is the cause of recent growth. Over the past few decades, the forest has notably expanded southeast, almost to cut off the land route between [[Cadun]] and [[Tardy]]. While this is unfortunate for merchants traveling by land, most residents of [[Cadun]] welcome the shorter journey to access wood, notably decreasing the cost of lumber for the winter months.
