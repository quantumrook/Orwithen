## Description

A keep on the southern edge of the Beryl Sea. It was supposed to help facilitate trade in the region, as the horn of the [[Bade Desert]] was treacherous to sail around, but constant raids kept stalling construction. After many attempts and numerous years, the project was abandoned and the half constructed keep maintains its lone watch on the horizon, its current state unknown.

Rumors say that there is wealth to be made with secrets left inside the keep or treasure from its possible new inhabitants, but those risky adventurers who have attempted to follow these rumors have yet to return.

## Layout

A small farming community had been set up to better supply the construction effort of the keep, as the [[Bay of Minas Coni]] offers plenty of flat and fertile land. This settlement is an hour's travel, southeast of the keep. The settlement features 10 sparsely situated farms and a small town center. The buildings are made from a local plaster and timber and have begun to rot away over the past 23 years.

The half-constructed keep is made from local slate in the hills nearby and sits atop a lone hill, overlooking the settlement and the bay. A dilapidated dock sits at the base of the hill.
