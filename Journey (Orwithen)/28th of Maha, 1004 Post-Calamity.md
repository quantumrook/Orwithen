## Summary
[[Tannyll Oridan]] summons [[Quinn Harcey]] and [[Leshanna Wynwarin]] to the [[Readings of Zaban]] in [[Cadun]] for a quest to search the nearby [[Chuddli Forest]] for signs of goblin activity. The two are given the approximate location of an abandoned monastery which may serve as the camp for the raiding goblins. Quinn receives some vague information about the monastery they're supposed to investigate from [[Aenbulf]], an old sage, and the two depart the city at a brisk pace. They manage to cover decent ground during the first day of travel, reaching the lake to the north, before being ambushed by local bandits. The fight looks to be in the bandits' favor before the tide quickly turns and things end poorly for them. One bandit opts to head to south to Cadun to meet [[Cirog]] and seek a new profession, while the other two run off into the wilderness at the sun finishes setting.

The sun gives rise a cool spring morning with small clouds dotting the sky. Quinn Harcey wakes up not too much later and he goes about getting dressed in his adventurering leathers and packing his bag for a long journey. Tannyll Oridan, the librarian, his boss, had sent word the previous day that she was in need of his skills for a new assignment. While the human rogue, enjoyed his time back in Cadun, he had started to grow stir-crazy. Just as he was finishing up, he hears a knock on his door. He grabs his pack and opens it up to see a tall fae-elf standing before him, Leshanna Wynwarin, his traveling companion was already dressed and waiting for him to finish.

"Shall we?" the human asks and Leshanna nods, leading him down the stairs of the [[Rusty Chain]]. The two stop give a nod to [[Palmer]] before heading out of the inn and into the streets of the Ravensthrone District. Making their way toward the Crystalarch Ward, the two arrive outside a four-story timber and stone building decorated with iconography to [[Zaban]] just as the sun began to peak over the inner city walls. Quinn pauses for a moment as he feels his stomach turn. Looking around, he doesn't seen anything out of the ordinary and chalks it up to a bad feeling about the note he received yesterday. The rogue's gut is rarely wrong when he gets a bad feeling, but he shakes his head as he can't point where the bad feeling is originating from. Walking fast to catch up with his companion, the two enter the library and make their way up the stone steps towards Tannyll's office.

They notice the door to her office is already open, but Quinn gives a gentle knock on the thick wooden door before stepping into the small room. The room is well lit with candles, as the only other source of light is from a small north facing window, which is still closed. *Probably to keep the cold in,* Quinn thinks as the two are greeted by a similar height. Leshanna has to duck as she enters the room, reminding Quinn of the subtle differences between the two elves. Outwardly, both Leshanna and Tannyll are very similar in appearance: pointed ears and an ageless visage, but Leshanna stands at least a full foot taller. With Cadun being predominately human, the library was constructed without fae-elven height in mind. 

The three exchange pleasantries before Tannyll gestures to a map of the [[Bracewater Headland]] laid out on her desk. "We've accumulated enough rumors of goblin activity in the Chuddli Forest that we think its time to look into them." Tannyll says as she points to a location in the wood about four days away, "Rangers have also reported an abandoned monastery here being used as their camp. We want you to verify the severity of these rumors and if nothing is amiss, map out the monastery for possible future research." She then gestures to a small leather sack on the side of the desk, "These are your funds for the trip, see to what preparations you deem fit. How long would you expect to be gone?"

Quinn and Leshanna study the map quickly and share a glance, "Four days out, four days back, at least one day to explore puts us just shy of an elevenday. If you don't hear from us by the 39th, I'd begin to get worried," says Quinn.

"I figured as much. Oh, before you leave," Tannyll replies, "make sure you have your identification on you. There are rumors of a disease spreading about the outer city and there's talk of restricting access to the high districts - you may need your placards to report back." The two nod and take one last look at the map before heading towards the door, with Leshanna grabbing the coin. 

She shuffles out about half and hands it over to Quinn, "I will need some more scribing supplies, if you'd be so kind: Dry Copper Ink and Chuddli pressed parchment should do. I'll be here studying a new ritual."

"Very well, I'll swing by [[Aenbulf]]'s and see what he's got." Quinn departs his companion to head to the nearby home of the sage. The journey is fortunately short, and Quinn can see smoke rising from the chimney, implying that the old man is awake. Entering the store front, he find Aenbulf enjoying a warm cup of tea by the fireplace. Quinn explains what his companion is looking for and the old man gestures towards a shelf containing a variety of vials. Finding what he needs and the paper on a similarly labeled counter, he hands over the gold to the old man before engaging in some idle chatter and inquiring about the monastery.

<div class="oracle">

**Q:** Does the sage know about the old monastery?
**A:** Yes. Keywords: Celebration, Force, Obsidian

</div>

The old man regales Quinn with a story about how the monastery was erected at the site of a great place of power in celebration of some name lost to time. Anebulf makes special emphasis on the monastery supposedly being constructed out of a slate obsidian not native to the region but cannot recall any more details. The sage offers to search his books but it may take a few days. Quinn asks the man to send a letter of his findings to the Rusty Chain under his name and offers the man some more coin, which is refused.

"Just tell me what you find, if it does exist," says the old man. Quinn nods and steps back out into the now much warmer air, heading back to the library and arrives just in time to see Leshanna step outside. He hands over the ritual components before the two make their way northward, across the river and towards the northwest gate leaving the city. Quinn fills his companion in on the brief bit of information obtained from Anebulf as the two traverse the increasingly busy city streets.

## North of Cadun

The two make quick progress during the first three hours of travel along the northern road before stopping to eat a quick brunch. The two discuss travel plans and find it unlikely to encounter anything of difficult until entering the forest, and agree to speed over stealth. The next six hours are uneventful as the sun rises high into the sky and past its zenith. A few merchants pass them, heading south towards Cadun, none of which mention goblins or trouble on the road.

As they crest a small hill, a large lake comes into view with the road winding around it to the east. Looking at the sun, the two companions figure they can make it halfway around before setting up camp for the night when the stumble upon some pottery shards. Seeing only a fine layer of dirt upon the shards, they conclude this must have occurred fairly recently, but its too far from the forest for the goblins to risk. Uneasy, the rogue draws his shuriken and the invoker mentally prepares an invocation.

Pushing on much slower now, the two scan the relatively flat land as they proceed for the next two hours without interruption. Relaxing a bit and assuming it was most likely the cause of poorly packed goods being josteled free, the two resume their original pace and just manage to reach the eastern edge of the lake as the sun begins to set. Heading some distance off the road, this time they do choose to move stealthy, with the rogue covering their tracks, as they search for a place to set up camp.

**Group Stealth Check:** : One pass, one fail.

As the two reach their campsite, an arrow whizzes past. "Bandits!" Quinn shouts as he ducks, spinning around loosing his shuriken back towards the sun. A painful short painful scream rings out into the still air before his blade teleports back to his hand. Emerging from over the hill, a group of bandits charge forward and two archers advance before kneeling and loosing two arrows which again fly wide of Quinn and Leshanna.

The remaining bandits quickly drop their weapons and raise their arms, surrendering. "You okay?" Quinn calls out to Leshanna.

"Yes, and you?"

"Yeah." Turning his attention to the three bandits, "How many others are there?"

"None," they all say in unison and nervously.

	Quinn, Leshanna: Passive Insight 19 -> You get the sense that they are being truthful.

"How many merchants did you hit today?"

	Quinn, Diplomacy vs Will: 20 vs 14 - Pass.

"You'd be the fourth," one of them says, and the other two give him a dirty look. "Screw it, I want to live. We thought you were simple travelers and could score some quick coin, didn't know you knew how to fight. He was the leader," the bandit says gesturing to the dead archer at Quinn's feet. Quinn wipes his blade clean on the corpse.

"What did you take?"

"Only coin, wanted to stay mobile for the day."

Quinn gets the rope out of his pack and binds the hands of each bandit behind their back and kicks their weapons away before signaling for Leshanna to follow him. "I would recommend against doing anything else stupid," he says dryly, gesturing to the other corpses nearby.  The two walk some distance away before Quinn looks back at the bandits and talks in a low voice "What do you want to do? We could turn in them in, but then we'd have to backtrack and they might not like the idea."

"I'm not fond of killing them after they have surrendered either," Leshanna says, matching Quinn's quiet volume. "Logically that leaves turning them loose but they know where we intended to set up camp..."

"If only it were earlier in the day," Quinn briefly looks back to the setting sun before returning his gaze to the bandits. "Hopefully they're sufficiently afraid and their desire to live is stronger than their stupidity..." He sighs as Leshanna begins walking back towards the bandits.

"Alright, listen up. You made one smart decision today, now you have the chance to make another one. Lucky for you, we're not fond of killing people after they surrender, and even more so, we don't want to deal with the hassle of escorting you back to the city. So, we're going to set you free, and what you choose to do from there is entirely up to you, but I'd strongly advise you to think before you act. You get to keep whatever is on you, but I'd like to think we'll never cross paths like this again." Quinn says diplomatically before walking back behind the bandits and unties the rope.

	Quinn, Diplomacy: 17+7 - Pass.

Quinn looks towards the archer, who spoke earlier, "And if you happen to have a change of heart about the line of work you're in, head back to Cadun and seek out [[Cirog]]. He's with the city guard, tell him that Quinn sent you and you're looking to start anew and he'll help you adjust." The archer nods, grabs his bow and quickly departs southward. The other two grab their clubs and run off to the east.

"You know, its dangerous going around telling people your name," Leshanna gestures to the two running east, "especially if they want pay back."

"Given how things went the first time, I'm not too worried about those two... but you do have a point. At least I didn't say your name," Quinn responds as he grabs his pack, "well, now we need to find a new spot.. maybe back on the other side of the hill?"

Leshanna nods as she finishes searching the bandit corpses, shaking 4 bags of coin, "Guess it wasn't the best day for them in multiple ways."

The two cross back over the hill and move some distance towards the road before setting up camp for the night, opting to avoid the attention a fire would bring. Leshanna takes the first watch as Quinn sleeps before waking him for his.
