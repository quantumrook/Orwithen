## Summary

The party run into [[Megara]] who teleports them half-a-day's journey south of their destination.

## Southern Outskirts, Chuddli Forest

<div class="oracle">
- Weather Check: Spring, 74 - Clear Skies
</div>

The hot air from yesterday threatens to lurk into the next before the clear skies of the night rapid drop the temperature and the morning begins a characteristically cool for spring. Quietly and efficiently, the three break camp and make their way back towards the road.

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** :: Is there an encounter?
**A:** :: Yes, the foliage suddenly becomes lush and thick in this area. It is a little out of place, and seems to have sprung up unnaturally, as if the result of some kind of natural magic.
</div>

Malvan slows his pace, until the other two catch up. In whispers, they ask "What is it? Trouble?" He nods in response but points ahead to a growth across the road.

"That shouldn't be here, I was just here less than an elevenday and it was a clear road..." Malvan's voice trails off.

"What, the plants?" Quinn asks confused.

"Yes. I'm telling you, the road meeting up with the north east path to Tardy had nothing like this."

"Give me a moment." Leshanna says, closes her eyes and stretching out her hand.

<div class="oracle">
**Leshanna** uses Detect Magic (Arcana, Trained). 27. :: *Primal Restoration*
**Q:** :: Is there a conjuration or magical zone present? (A certainty, +7)
**A:** :: Yes, and: Escape, Break, Singing
</div>

"Its some sort of restorative enchantment, fairly powerful." The growth grows towards the three.

"Uh... did anyone else just see it grow closer?" Quinn asks. Leshanna looks at him bewildered before Malvan agrees.

"We can cut either west or east, but I'd advise going through it." Leshanna says flatly.

"West," Malvan responds in kind.

The three start walking west as the growth grows further down the road, seemingly in a burst every few seconds.

"We might want to go a bit south too..." Quinn says uneasy, "...And there's another problem, it doesn't stand out as much in the wood as it does on the road.."

"I can still sense it and should be able to guide us around it. Malvan, keep track of how far we stray from the road."

"Got it."

"Does anyone else hear the singing, or am I just going crazy now?" Quinn asks. 

"No.. I hear it too..."

"Agreed.."

"Great... now what?"

"Let me think.." Leshanna pauses and closes her eyes, trying to recall information about the forest. Quinn, shaking off his nerves gets a similar idea. 

<div class="oracle">

**Leshanna** uses Arcana (Monster Knowledge). 15. :: Name, type, keywords,
</div>

"If memory serves, that's a dryad singing, and it'd explain the powerful nature magic at work," Leshanna says.

"We've also been tracking the growth of the forest southward at an increasing rate, fare beyond what we'd normally expect, over the past couple of decades," Quinn adds.

"So where does that put us?" Malvan asks, "I mean we could go directly east until we hit the other road, and go around, but that'd add at least a day to the trip, if not more. So, we know what's causing it, what do we do? fight it? run from it? parley with it?" His voice gets less confident with each question. Quinn and Leshanna share a look.

"Well, that is an interesting point. We've done no harm to the forest, we might be able to explain our purpose and be granted safe passage." Leshanna replies, "I mean, I do share a kin-ship with the forest and dryads as a Fae-elf..."

Quinn looks to Leshanna, "I mean, its your call, you'd be the one doing most, if not all of the talking..."

"I think we're out of time," Malvan says with an outstretched hand, pointing at a beautiful fae-elf walking towards them as the singing grows louder. Leshanna takes a deep breath and looks to the other two, "Don't reach for your weapons unless it is absolutely clear we have no choice. We might not even win this if it comes to that... So, let's not give any reason for hostility, shall we?"

Quinn forces himself to fight his urge to have his hand on his sword and Malvan shifts uncomfortably before taking a few deep breaths. He notes the smell of sweet flowers that wasn't there before.

"Hail sacred guardian of the glade, we do not seek to trespass unwaranted." Leshanna calls out. The dryad stops, stares for a moment, the beautiful singing stopping.

"Then why are you here?"

> **Dyrad** weariness factor: 3

"We seek an old monastery. There are rumors of goblins using it as their raiding camp, we desire nothing more than to see if it is true, and expunge them if so."

> **Leshanna** *Diplomacy*: 21.
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1.

"That maybe true, but you are still trespassing on a sacred glade."

"Forgive us, for if we knew so, we wouldn't. Our history mentions nothing of the glade, and so we have mistakenly stepped where we shouldn't." Quinn quickly undoes his belt, letting his sword and shuriken pouch drop to the ground and holds his hands up. Malvan quickly follows suit, first dropping his quiver then unslinging and tossing his bow gently to the ground.

> **Leshanna** *Diplomacy*: 21.
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1.

"Your companions discard their weapons but you do not, why?"

"Because we share a kindred spirit, we are both of the fae. I know that you will not attack unprovoked, just as I will not. We have done nothing but tell the truth to your ears."

> **Dryad** *Insight*: 24.

The dryad pauses for a moment, thinking about the words Leshanna has said.

"I will grant you safe passage on one condition: bring me the heads of these goblins who dare defile the grove."

In elvish, Quinn pipes up, "Forgive my intrusion, but we only have a few traveler's word that there may be goblins, we don't know for sure. What if we don't find any?"

> **Quinn** *Diplomacy*: 14.
> **Dryad** weariness remains unchanged.

The dryad snaps to look at Quinn, be eases a bit as he speaks in moderately decent fae-elvish. "We will deal with it upon your return. If you have been as truthful as you claim, then you have no cause for concern."

Leshanna looks back at Quinn, then Malvan who then takes his turn to speak, "Oh beautiful protector, if I may, my companions are unsure of this monastery's existence, is there aught you can tell us about it? The quicker we find it, the quicker we will no longer be in your grove."

> **Malvan** *Diplomacy*: 23.
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1, she is now neutral with the party.

The dryad looks to Leshanna before looking back to Malvan, "You would be wise to ask your fae companion the dangers of asking favors of the fae." She inhales and exhales deeply, a fresh wave of floral scent washing over the party. "I can do better than tell, but you will have to pay the kindness in kind."

Malvan looks between Quinn and Leshanna, "Well? I mean, the fewer days in the grove the better from where I stand." He shifts nervously.

Leshanna sighs and thinks for a moment before turning back to the dryad, "What would it be that you would ask of us?"

She smiles politely, "tell their people this road belongs to the forest now. They may still have the other path, but the northwest belongs to the grove."

"We can relay your message, but cannot promise that all will heed the warning."

"The warning is sufficient, the fools will be fools."

Quinn looks between his companions, "Well, the only others I know of on this fork besides us are nothing but trouble, so I think it might be a fair trade.."

Leshanna sighs, "Tannyll is not going to like this, but then again, we now know why the forest has been growing so much." She looks back to Malvan before the dryad, "Very well, I, Leshanna Wynwarin, pledge to follow our end of the bargain. What is yours?"

"I will take you to your obsidian monastery, the glade need not be disturbed. Grab your weapons, lest you leave them behind." She addresses Quinn and Malvan. The two quickly resecure their arms before stepping forward, up to Leshanna. The dryad gestures to a tree near the three of them, and suddenly the bark folds in on itself creating a hole glowing with brilliant primal energy. "This tree will take you half a day away from your destination. Head due north, that is, unless you'd like to be closer."

"Half-a-day journey is more than kind enough," Leshanna quickly cuts in, "Oh.. we didn't catch your name protector?"

> **Leshanna** *Diplomacy*: 21.
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1.

"Megara," she smiles, "go quickly, the portal will not stay open for long. And remember, the grove is watching carefully." Quinn and Malvan quickly follow in Leshanna's brisk footsteps, noding to the dryad before touching the tree and being sucked into darkness. A few moments later, their vision clears, and they find themselves in a completely different wood. The tree they have laid their hands on seems to be the only healthy one in sight.

## Deep, Chuddli Forest

The three quickly fan out and search their surroundings for a few moments before regrouping. "Well, that's quite handy." Quinn says in an upbeat tone.

"I just hope the Readings of Zaban will be more pleased with what we find than what we promised," Leshanna says neutrally.

"What? tell people not to travel an old road that is really only used by bandits and the like?" Malvan cuts in

"Worse is if the monastery is of interest other than an old worn down building, we just denied any further travel to it for the foreseeable future."

"Well, we'll just have to make sure we leave no secret behind then," Quinn responds with a smile. "Also, did I hear that right? obsidian monastery?"

"You did. Isn't that what Aenbulf said?"

"Right.. he was saying..it was made of slate obsidian not native to the region and that it was constructed at a great place of power in celebration to someone he doesn't remember the name of."

Leshanna looks around, "the state of the grove here has me worried about that last bit. Look, everything else is in some state of decay or already dead."

"Then we best not stay long."

The other two nod before resuming their traveling formation, with Malvan up front and Quinn and Leshanna flanking. Malvan pauses for a moment, looking around, as if he's being watched but doesn't see anything out of the ordinary. He tries to shake it off, but the feeling persists and he grumbles to himself for a moment before the three continue onwards. Quinn lets out a soft whistle and points up, noting that even the clear skies from the early morning have taken on a weird tint, almost like a shade of black permeates the area they now walk.

Making relatively cautious but strong progress, its only a few hours before the party catches the glimpse of hard rigid lines between the trees. Malvan signals and the other two halt, and all three listen intently to their surroundings. Normally the lack of wildlife noises would be cause for concern, but its been that way for the past few hours. 

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** :: Do they hear goblins?
**A:** :: Yes and: Smell, Punish, Mirror
</div>

Fortunately, the three had crouched and stopped making noise when they did, as Malvan signals trouble: three goblins ahead.

Combat ends.

> The group gains 400 xp.

Malvan makes a quick detour to cut the ears off each goblin and tucks them in a pouch. The three quickly regroup after dispatching the scout party and catch their breath before pressing forward.  As they draw near, a black silhouette of a two storey building looms behind the decaying trees. Time and the weather has not been kind to this building, causing much damage over the years since its last use.

Leshanna and Quinn share a look and shrug as if to say they don't recognize the architecture and Leshanna quickly pulls out some parchment paper and makes a crude sketch noting anything she can think of import such as the two hands outstretched reaching for what appears to be a light source. As she stows her supplies, Quinn points out a dying campfire near one of the still functioning entrances, as evidenced by the lack of debris around it.

The three exchange looks and nod before pressing forward, Quinn, doing his best to mask their trail and keep rear watch as Malvan and Leshanna scan up ahead. The approach a thick wooden door, surprisingly intact and not rotted like the surroundings and Quinn takes over, scanning for traps. 

<div class="oracle">
**Quinn** *perception*: Nat 20.
</div>

Finding none, he does notice that the door appears to be stuck and unlocked. He looks back to the other two, who nod, and he braces himself before pushing against it.

<div class="oracle">
**Quinn** *strength*: Nat 20.
</div>

With just the right amount of leverage, he pushes the door past the uneven floor and it swings wide open to an empty looking room. Disturbingly, candles are set up about the perimeter, offering a shadowy illumination and many questions. The three carefully funnel inside, gently propping the door closed behind them.

<div class="oracle">
**Quinn** *Dungeoneering*: 23. :: Expert Knowledge.
</div>

Quinn holds up a hand to signal a halt while he scans the room, something he has seen his gut does not like. Peering about, he notices several openings in the ceiling which would be perfect for traps to drop down out of. Scanning the room, he sees various pressure plates which he points out to the other two in a hushed whisper, "don't step there, bad things will drop." The three examine the room, looking for any clues.

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** :: Are there any clues to the monastery's origins or the goblin presence in this room?
**A:** :: Yes.
</div>

As they move about the space, a low whistle draws the attention of the other two to one of the corners where Malvan is pointing. There appears to be a stack of various goods, amongst other items. Leshanna responds and points to two other corners and Quinn curses his human eye sight. "Well, we have the truth of the rumors for sure now," Quinn thinks to himself. After finishing scanning the room, they see three other possible routes to take, a door to the north, a door west, and a door to the south. The door to the south appears to be of weaker construction than the other two and the group carefully stacks up as Quinn attempts to open the door.

<div class="oracle">
**Quinn** *strength*: 17.
</div>

This door, like the first, is easily opened with the right leverage and a winding hallway is revealed to the party. Quinn takes a quick glance and signals the okay to push forward, guiding the party where to step to ensure their presence remains a surprise.

<div class="oracle">
**Quinn** *stealth*: Nat 20 + 10.
	-  Group Stealth Mod: +10
- **Leshanna** *stealth*: 15 + 10.
- **Malvan** *stealth*: 15 + 10.
</div>

About to round the corner, Malvan puts a hand on Quinn's shoulder and pulls him back right before a goblin wanders down the hall before turning around and going back the direction it came from. Quinn steps out behind it and strikes with his sword...

<div class="oracle">
- **Quinn** *sly flourish* **Skullcleaver 1**
	- Crit. 28 damage.
</div>

and expertly administers a coup de grace, killing it before a scream can escape. Malvan then steps up behind Quinn and looses two arrows at the next patrolling goblin.

<div class="oracle">
- **Malvan** *twin strike* 
	-**Skullcleaver 2**: Crit. 26 damage.
	-**Skullcleaver 3**: Crit. 18 damage.
</div>

The second goblin falls to the ground with a thud as Leshanna steps out from behind the corner and sends a ray of radiant blue light at the last remaining visible goblin.

<div class="oracle">
- **Leshanna** *avenging light* **Skullcleaver 3**
	- Hit. 7 damage.

It lets out a scream of pain as the radiant flames burn its skin.

Combat ends.

> Party gains 800 experience.

The group, surprisingly unscathed, takes a moment to catch their breath and calm themselves before pushing on to the door up ahead. Malvan stops to cut off the ears again.

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** :: Does the door open as a result of the fight?
**A:** :: No.
</div>

Quinn gets to the door and checks it for traps, noting that its not stuck and also not locked. He looks back to the other three before swinging it open to another empty room. Taking a moment to scan the room, Quinn sees nothing of concern and waves the other two in. Leshanna lets out a low whistle and points to the left wall. Quinn has to walk up closer to see it and reads "Death is the only exit." Seeing a door to the north, they assume it leads back to the treasure room and focus on the wooden portcullis to the west. Peeking through, they see a stone sphere sitting in the middle of the room and a strong stench assails their noses. Leaning back just in time, a zombified hand in a black robe swipes at Quinn's face.
