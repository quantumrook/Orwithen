The night passes uneventfully for the two adventurers that decide to eat a cold breakfast before breaking camp at sunrise. Unfortunately though, the heat of yesterday's sparse sky seems to have stuck around through the night making an unusually warm spring morning. Quinn and Leshanna both remove their chest armor begrudgingly in an attempt to stave off the heat and sweat for as long as possible. The two set off at 1.5 time pace, attempting to use their proximity to fresh water to their advantage, knowing they'll need to replenish soon and often.

Taking a short rest every two hours to drink and catch their breath, they make progress about the lake until reaching the northern end and get ready to set off northward at a normal pace. Just as they're about to set off, they hear a "Wait for me!" and turn around bewildered. They see a humanoid figure running up the road towards them, waving an arm. Unsure what to expect, Quinn rests his hand on his sword and Leshanna takes a step back and readies her staff. As the figure gets closer the two notice that something seems familiar about them but they can't quite place it. Panting, sweating, and out of breath, the man comes to a halt near the two, "Wait... just... a.. second..."

"Hold on, you're the archer from last night!" Quinn exclaims as he draws his blade. "What is it you want?"

"I.. want..." the man holds up a hand to signal to give him a chance to catch his breath. After a few moments, he regains his composure, "I want to join you. I was thinking about last night and went to see Cirog, but figured you're already on a job and the best time to start is now. I've been trying to catch up to you two all morning but this heat is just something else..."

Quinn looks at Leshanna and sheaths his blade, speaking in elvish "Great... more complications."

"I swear on my word, I'll cause you no trouble."

"Forgive us for doubting you, but you did try to kill or rob us last night."

"True, but you spared my life and I owe you for that. I am a skilled ranger and know this area quite well."

"And how do we know you don't already have a bounty on your head."

"You don't, but I don't. I mean, I was strong armed into recently joining the crew, last night was my first 'job' beyond watching the gear. I realize I have nothing to prove the sincerity of my word, but all I'm asking for is a chance, the same chance you offered me last night."

Quinn groans and looks towards Leshanna who replies in elvish, "You did tell him to make smarter decisions, but trust needs to be earned."

The man holds up his hand to politely interrupt, also in elvish, "Apologies, but I figure its best that you know I'm a half-elf. In the interest of building trust." The two look a bit surprised and examine the man more closely. Now that they knew what they were looking for, the tell-tale signs were present: the ageless visage, the slender and tall physique, and even the slightly pointed ears.

"I appreciate the heart, but we're on a time sensitive mission and can't afford the distraction. Cirog really is your best bet if you're sincere about turning things around," Quinn replies.

The man slumps slightly, looking defeated, before straightening up again, "Just one day. That's all I ask, I can prove my sincerity. The day is already hot and its just going to get worse but I know where we can find fresh water along the road north that not many are aware of. There's a stream that feeds into this lake about 150 ft west of the road about 3 hours ahead."

Quinn thinks for a moment before looking to Leshanna, "He does have a point."

"One day." Leshanna says to the man.

"Thank you, and the name is Malvan, Malvan Crowsworn." He says smiling as he walks up to join the two, "Would you prefer I stay back or take the lead?"

"For the day, we'll be on the road, so lead away Malvan. I am Quinn and this Leshanna."

"One of these days you're going to learn to stop giving everyone our names," says Leshanna, playfully poking Quinn.The ranger hides a smile as he takes the lead, walking 20 paces ahead of the other two.

## Southern Outskirts, Chuddli Forest

Two hours into the journey, the three stop for another water break under a lone tree off the side of the road. Quinn shakes his head as he drinks from his waterskin, "His enthusiasm is infectious, we covered more ground in the past two hours than we did by ourselves."

"Maybe he's forcing you to take bigger strides," Leshanna jests. Malvan lets out a small chuckle, wiping his brow.

"I'm going to go scout ahead a little bit. Call it eagerness to prove myself, but I don't like being so open with the hill up ahead," Malvan says, turning to face the two.

"Knock yourself out," Quinn replies, making a mock toast with his waterskin. The ranger breaks off from the tree, staying off the road and deftly moves towards the crest of the hill, only slowing in stride as he nears the top.

"I think I might almost miss him," Quinn says with a smile before taking another swig. Suddenly, the ranger drops to a crouch before quickly turning around and heading back. Quinn's gut twists as Leshanna looks back to see Malvan. An arrow comes sailing over the hill and lands 60 feet away from the tree. Quinn and Leshanna immediately stop relaxing and begin putting on their armor from their packs, getting only halfway done by the time Malvan returns.

"Bandits. More from the crew. 3 Archers, 3 bruisers, and 7 rabble." Malvan says quickly, dropping his back and grabbing his quiver. "They should be cresting in a few moments."

"How do we know this isn't a trap?" Quinn asks dryly as he finishes putting on his leather armor and draws his shuriken. "Damn, we're too far for me to get a good shot."

"Because I'm not that stupid. I wouldn't risk getting this close to you if I wanted revenge."

"Fair enough." Leshanna says fixing the belt to hold her chain mail in place.

"I'll cover you, press up," the ranger says, knocking an arrow in his longbow and drawing it. A moment later a figure crests the hill and Malvan looses his arrow with deadly aim. "Make that 6 rabble. Now is not the time to question."

"Fair enough," Quinn replies, staying low but rushing towards the hill with Leshanna close behind. Two more arrows sail over their heads landing fair behind them. Malvan knocks another arrow and runs forward a bit, not to be left behind. Leshanna is first to crest the hill, her stride carrying her faster than Quinn's. She quickly confirms what Malvan said to be true and raises her staff as it glows a deep blue and releases a powerful invocation.
