## Summary

[[Malvan Crowsworn]], with much effort, convinces [[Quinn Harcey]] and [[Leshanna Wynwarin]] to let him join them on their quest. He quickly proves his sincerity by warning them of an impending ambush by bandits and assists the two in dispatching their foes. Concerned by the relatively sudden revenge, Quinn asks Malvan for more detail about the bandit gang and they conclude that they have upset the [[Iron Circle]]. While searching the bodies for two familiar faces, they are ambushed by a gnoll and two heynas. Quinn is knocked unconscious (first PC death save) but is stabilized. The three venture onwards, uneventfully, into the forest and make camp.

## North of Cadun, Unnamed Lake

<div class="oracle">

- Weather Check: Spring, 93 - Scorching Heat
> Blistering heat that is unpleasant to travel in. Creatures that attempt to travel during day light hours require twice the ration of water, and creature that travel for 4 or more hours or engage in heavy activity for 1 or more hour during the day and do not immediately take a short or long rest under cover must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of Exhaustion.

</div>

The night passes uneventfully for the two adventurers that decide to eat a cold breakfast before breaking camp at sunrise. Unfortunately though, the heat of yesterday's sparse sky seems to have stuck around through the night making an unusually warm spring morning. Quinn and Leshanna both remove their chest armor begrudgingly in an attempt to stave off the heat and sweat for as long as possible. The two set off at 1.5 time pace, attempting to use their proximity to fresh water to their advantage, knowing they'll need to replenish soon and often.

</div>

Taking a short rest every two hours to drink and catch their breath, they make progress about the lake until reaching the northern end and get ready to set off northward at a normal pace. Just as they're about to set off, they hear a "Wait for me!" and turn around bewildered. They see a humanoid figure running up the road towards them, waving an arm. Unsure what to expect, Quinn rests his hand on his sword and Leshanna takes a step back and readies her staff. As the figure gets closer the two notice that something seems familiar about them but they can't quite place it. Panting, sweating, and out of breath, the man comes to a halt near the two, "Wait... just... a.. second..."

"Hold on, you're the archer from last night!" Quinn exclaims as he draws his blade. "What is it you want?"

"I.. want..." the man holds up a hand to signal to give him a chance to catch his breath. After a few moments, he regains his composure, "I want to join you. I was thinking about last night and went to see [[Cirog]], but figured you're already on a job and the best time to start is now. I've been trying to catch up to you two all morning but this heat is just something else..."

Quinn looks at Leshanna and sheaths his blade, speaking in elvish "Great... more complications."

"I swear on my word, I'll cause you no trouble."

"Forgive us for doubting you, but you did try to kill or rob us last night."

"True, but you spared my life and I owe you for that. I am a skilled ranger and know this area quite well."

"And how do we know you don't already have a bounty on your head."

"You don't, but I don't. I mean, I was strong armed into recently joining the crew, last night was my first 'job' beyond watching the gear. I realize I have nothing to prove the sincerity of my word, but all I'm asking for is a chance, the same chance you offered me last night."

Quinn groans and looks towards Leshanna who replies in elvish, "You did tell him to make smarter decisions, but trust needs to be earned."

The man holds up his hand to politely interrupt, also in elvish, "Apologies, but I figure its best that you know I'm a half-elf. In the interest of building trust." The two look a bit surprised and examine the man more closely. Now that they knew what they were looking for, the tell-tale signs were present: the ageless visage, the slender and tall physique, and even the slightly pointed ears.

"I appreciate the heart, but we're on a time sensitive mission and can't afford the distraction. Cirog really is your best bet if you're sincere about turning things around," Quinn replies.

The man slumps slightly, looking defeated, before straightening up again, "Just one day. That's all I ask, I can prove my sincerity. The day is already hot and its just going to get worse but I know where we can find fresh water along the road north that not many are aware of. There's a stream that feeds into this lake about 150 ft west of the road about 3 hours ahead."

Quinn thinks for a moment before looking to Leshanna, "He does have a point."

"One day." Leshanna says to the man.

"Thank you, and the name is Malvan, Malvan Crowsworn." He says smiling as he walks up to join the two, "Would you prefer I stay back or take the lead?"

"For the day, we'll be on the road, so lead away Malvan. I am Quinn and this Leshanna."

"One of these days you're going to learn to stop giving everyone our names," says Leshanna, playfully poking Quinn.The ranger hides a smile as he takes the lead, walking 20 paces ahead of the other two.

## Southern Outskirts, Chuddli Forest

Two hours into the journey, the three stop for another water break under a lone tree off the side of the road. Quinn shakes his head as he drinks from his waterskin, "His enthusiasm is infectious, we covered more ground in the past two hours than we did by ourselves."

"Maybe he's forcing you to take bigger strides," Leshanna jests. Malvan lets out a small chuckle, wiping his brow.

"I'm going to go scout ahead a little bit. Call it eagerness to prove myself, but I don't like being so open with the hill up ahead," Malvan says, turning to face the two.

"Knock yourself out," Quinn replies, making a mock toast with his waterskin. The ranger breaks off from the tree, staying off the road and deftly moves towards the crest of the hill, only slowing in stride as he nears the top.

"I think I might almost miss him," Quinn says with a smile before taking another swig. Suddenly, the ranger drops to a crouch before quickly turning around and heading back. Quinn's gut twists as Leshanna looks back to see Malvan. An arrow comes sailing over the hill and lands 60 feet away from the tree. Quinn and Leshanna immediately stop relaxing and begin putting on their armor from their packs, getting only halfway done by the time Malvan returns.

"Bandits. More from the crew. 3 Archers, 3 bruisers, and 7 rabble." Malvan says quickly, dropping his back and grabbing his quiver. "They should be cresting in a few moments."

"How do we know this isn't a trap?" Quinn asks dryly as he finishes putting on his leather armor and draws his shuriken. "Damn, we're too far for me to get a good shot."

"Because I'm not that stupid. I wouldn't risk getting this close to you if I wanted revenge."

"Fair enough." Leshanna says fixing the belt to hold her chain mail in place.

"I'll cover you, press up," the ranger says, knocking an arrow in his longbow and drawing it. A moment later a figure crests the hill and Malvan looses his arrow with deadly aim. "Make that 6 rabble. Now is not the time to question."

"Fair enough," Quinn replies, staying low but rushing towards the hill with Leshanna close behind. Two more arrows sail over their heads landing fair behind them. Malvan knocks another arrow and runs forward a bit, not to be left behind. Leshanna is first to crest the hill, her stride carrying her faster than Quinn's. She quickly confirms what Malvan said to be true and raises her staff as it glows a deep blue and releases a powerful invocation.

With Malvan's two arrows sinking into the final bandit and dropping them dead, . 

	Quickly searching the bodies, the group obtains Parcel 1 and Parcel 5. 1325 Encounter XP. Party levels up to level 6.

Leshanna limps back over the hill towards the tree while Malvan and Quinn search the bodies for anything of interest. On the Bersker's back is a Duelist's lightblade of +2. Malvan finds 550 gp in total. After a few moments, all three group back up at the tree.

"Well, any life-debt you feel like you owed, I think is repaid." Quinn says, taking a big swig of water. Leshanna nods in agreement as she finishes bandaging herself up. Malvan smiles and follows Quinn's lead in taking a big sip of water before taking off his armor. 

"I guess my former crew was bigger than they let on, but kinda makes sense in hindsight. It doesn't change anything as far as I'm concerned, but we may have made some powerful enemies."

"Do you know who they are? like did the crew have a name they went by?"

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** Does Malvan know the name of the bandits?
**A:** Yes.
</div>

"They didn't say it out right, but the outpost had a very prominent iron circle displayed. So, either they are playing a dangerous game, or the Iron Circle is going to be a thorn for a long while."

"That'd explain the magic weaponry and coordination in tactics. More coordinated than your typical roadside highway men."

Leshanna gives Quinn a look, "I'm not going to say it, but we need to get word to Cirog."

"We need to check for your two acquaintances amongst the dead again." Quinn says, looking at Malvan. The three finish recovering from the heat before searching the corpses for familiar faces.

<div class="oracle">

An arrow thuds into a corpse next to Malvan, breaking the uneasy silence alongside two howls. The three turn towards the noise and see a gnoll with two heynas charging towards them. Dropping their gear, the three ready their weapons.

Malvan props Quinn up so that Leshanna can administer a healing potion to Quinn, and he comes to a few moments later. "W-what happened?"

"You tried to die on us." Malvan replies, "Took a good hit from the Gnoll's handaxe."

Quinn shakes his head, disoriented as the healing potion finishes taking effect. "Ugh.. I'm really not liking this heat today..."

"Agreed, we shouldn't stay too much longer, else we find its companions."

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** Are the other two bandits present?
**A:** Yes
</div>

Satisfied that the two other bandits from the night before are present, the three make their way back towards the road and continue northward. "I think its implied at this point you can come with us, assuming you still want to." Quinn says to Malvan. "Fair warning, its going to be more of what just happened."

"Understood, but that doesn't change anything - I mean, if I'm to be sincere to my word. Besides, I seem to be coming out of these scraps better than either of you." he responds in a light-hearted jest.

The three reach the edge of the forest as the sun begins to set, making use of Malvan's knowledge to wash off the heat and refill their waterskins. "Know of any good spots to camp, preferably unnoticed?"

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** Does Malvan's knowledge help in setting up camp?
**A:** Yes
</div>

Malvan nods and leads the other two off the road a bit as Quinn works to mask their trail. About an hour later, Malvan signals that they've arrived and the three fan out, searching for any issues before returning to set up camp. Leshanna leaves to grab some timber as Malvan and Quinn dig two holes for the subdued fire. The hot air sticks around, even as the sun sets, and Malvan gets to know Leshanna and Quinn more.

"So, are you just adventurers for hire or is there something more?"

"We're actually with the Delver's of Zaban on a mission to verify rumors of goblin raiders in the forest. Supposedly they're making camp at an abandoned monastery a few more days worth of travel into the forest."

"Ah, I've only heard of the Delver's in passing, what is it you actually do?"

Quinn looks to Leshanna, "That's a great question I don't have the words for.."

"In a simple sense, Quinn is an adventurer for hire and he assists me on missions given by the order. I am a Seeker, a devout follower of Zaban, and its my mission to find knowledge for the order. In this case, the answer to the rumors is the knowledge I seek, as well as information about this monastery, as we don't have any on it."

"I see... And what does it take to join this order? I'm just exploring my options as I don''t want to wear out my welcome by being a lost puppy for too long.."

"Its been so long.. but I think if memory serves, Leshanna ran into me while on a mission and requested my services?" Quinn asks looking to Leshanna.

"Its only been 3 years, have you already forgotten? But yes, that's the gist. And then you came with me to report the conclusion and Tannyll asked if you'd be interested in continuing to work for the order." 

"Well, to be fair, its been a rather busy three years..." Quinn says smiling. "Well, as the new guy, I hope you don't mind second watch.."

"Fair is fair, I typically wake up rather easily anyways."

"Good because I don't, which is why I take last watch."

<div class="oracle">
**Q:** Is there an encounter tonight?
**A:** No
</div>

The evening passes quietly into morning as the three rotate between watching and sleeping.
