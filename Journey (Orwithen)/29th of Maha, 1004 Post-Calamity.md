The night passes uneventfully for the two adventurers that decide to eat a cold breakfast before breaking camp at sunrise. Unfortunately though, the heat of yesterday's sparse sky seems to have stuck around through the night making an unusually warm spring morning. Quinn and Leshanna both remove their chest armor begrudgingly in an attempt to stave off the heat and sweat for as long as possible. The two set off at 1.5 time pace, attempting to use their proximity to fresh water to their advantage, knowing they'll need to replenish soon and often.

Taking a short rest every two hours to drink and catch their breath, they make progress about the lake until reaching the northern end and get ready to set off northward at a normal pace.
