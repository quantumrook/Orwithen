# 28th of Maha, 1004 Post-Calamity

### Summary
{{quote
*Tannyll Oridan* summons *Quinn Harcey* and *Leshanna Wynwarin* to the **Readings of Zaban** in **Cadun** for a quest to search the nearby **Chuddli Forest** for signs of goblin activity. The two are given the approximate location of an abandoned monastery which may serve as the camp for the raiding goblins. Quinn receives some vague information about the monastery they're supposed to investigate from *Aenbulf*, an old sage, and the two depart the city at a brisk pace. They manage to cover decent ground during the first day of travel, reaching the lake to the north, before being ambushed by local bandits. The fight looks to be in the bandits' favor before the tide quickly turns and things end poorly for them. One bandit opts to head to south to Cadun to meet *Cirog* and seek a new profession, while the other two run off into the wilderness at the sun finishes setting.

### Cadun

The sun gives rise a cool spring morning with small clouds dotting the sky. Quinn Harcey wakes up not too much later and he goes about getting dressed in his adventurering leathers and packing his bag for a long journey. Tannyll Oridan, the librarian, his boss, had sent word the previous day that she was in need of his skills for a new assignment. While the human rogue, enjoyed his time back in Cadun, he had started to grow stir-crazy. Just as he was finishing up, he hears a knock on his door. He grabs his pack and opens it up to see a tall fae-elf standing before him, Leshanna Wynwarin, his traveling companion was already dressed and waiting for him to finish.

"Shall we?" the human asks and Leshanna nods, leading him down the stairs of the Rusty Chain. The two stop give a nod to Palmer before heading out of the inn and into the streets of the Ravensthrone District. Making their way toward the Crystalarch Ward, the two arrive outside a four-story timber and stone building decorated with iconography to Zaban just as the sun began to peak over the inner city walls. Quinn pauses for a moment as he feels his stomach turn. Looking around, he doesn't seen anything out of the ordinary and chalks it up to a bad feeling about the note he received yesterday. The rogue's gut is rarely wrong when he gets a bad feeling, but he shakes his head as he can't point where the bad feeling is originating from. Walking fast to catch up with his companion, the two enter the library and make their way up the stone steps towards Tannyll's office.

They notice the door to her office is already open, but Quinn gives a gentle knock on the thick wooden door before stepping into the small room. The room is well lit with candles, as the only other source of light is from a small north facing window, which is still closed. *Probably to keep the cold in,* Quinn thinks as the two are greeted by a similar height. Leshanna has to duck as she enters the room, reminding Quinn of the subtle differences between the two elves. Outwardly, both Leshanna and Tannyll are very similar in appearance: pointed ears and an ageless visage, but Leshanna stands at least a full foot taller. With Cadun being predominately human, the library was constructed without fae-elven height in mind. 

The three exchange pleasantries before Tannyll gestures to a map of the Bracewater Headland laid out on her desk. "We've accumulated enough rumors of goblin activity in the Chuddli Forest that we think its time to look into them." Tannyll says as she points to a location in the wood about four days away, "Rangers have also reported an abandoned monastery here being used as their camp. We want you to verify the severity of these rumors and if nothing is amiss, map out the monastery for possible future research." She then gestures to a small leather sack on the side of the desk, "These are your funds for the trip, see to what preparations you deem fit. How long would you expect to be gone?"

Quinn and Leshanna study the map quickly and share a glance, "Four days out, four days back, at least one day to explore puts us just shy of an elevenday. If you don't hear from us by the 39th, I'd begin to get worried," says Quinn.

"I figured as much. Oh, before you leave," Tannyll replies, "make sure you have your identification on you. There are rumors of a disease spreading about the outer city and there's talk of restricting access to the high districts - you may need your placards to report back." The two nod and take one last look at the map before heading towards the door, with Leshanna grabbing the coin. 

She shuffles out about half and hands it over to Quinn, "I will need some more scribing supplies, if you'd be so kind: Dry Copper Ink and Chuddli pressed parchment should do. I'll be here studying a new ritual."

"Very well, I'll swing by Aenbulf's and see what he's got." Quinn departs his companion to head to the nearby home of the sage. The journey is fortunately short, and Quinn can see smoke rising from the chimney, implying that the old man is awake. Entering

\page
the store front, he finds Aenbulf enjoying a warm cup of tea by the fireplace. Quinn explains what his companion is looking for and the old man gestures towards a shelf containing a variety of vials. Finding what he needs and the paper on a similarly labeled counter, he hands over the gold to the old man before engaging in some idle chatter and inquiring about the monastery.

{{note
**Q:** :: Does the sage know about the old monastery?
**A:** :: Yes. Keywords: Celebration, Force, Obsidian
}}
The old man regales Quinn with a story about how the monastery was erected at the site of a great place of power in celebration of some name lost to time. Anebulf makes special emphasis on the monastery supposedly being constructed out of a slate obsidian not native to the region but cannot recall any more details. The sage offers to search his books but it may take a few days. Quinn asks the man to send a letter of his findings to the Rusty Chain under his name and offers the man some more coin, which is refused.

"Just tell me what you find, if it does exist," says the old man. Quinn nods and steps back out into the now much warmer air, heading back to the library and arrives just in time to see Leshanna step outside. He hands over the ritual components before the two make their way northward, across the river and towards the northwest gate leaving the city. Quinn fills his companion in on the brief bit of information obtained from Anebulf as the two traverse the increasingly busy city streets.

### North of Cadun

The two make quick progress during the first three hours of travel along the northern road before stopping to eat a quick brunch. The two discuss travel plans and find it unlikely to encounter anything of difficult until entering the forest, and agree to speed over stealth. The next six hours are uneventful as the sun rises high into the sky and past its zenith. A few merchants pass them, heading south towards Cadun, none of which mention goblins or trouble on the road.

As they crest a small hill, a large lake comes into view with the road winding around it to the east. Looking at the sun, the two companions figure they can make it halfway around before setting up camp for the night when the stumble upon some pottery shards. Seeing only a fine layer of dirt upon the shards, they conclude this must have occurred fairly recently, but its too far from the forest for the goblins to risk. Uneasy, the rogue draws his shuriken and the invoker mentally prepares an invocation.

Pushing on much slower now, the two scan the relatively flat land as they proceed for the next two hours without interruption. Relaxing a bit and assuming it was most likely the cause of poorly packed goods being jostled free, the two resume their original pace and just manage to reach the eastern edge of the lake as the sun begins to set. Heading some distance off the road, this time they do choose to move stealthy, with the rogue covering their tracks, as they search for a place to set up camp.

{{note
**Group Stealth Check:** :: One pass, one fail.
}}

As the two reach their campsite, an arrow whizzes past. "Bandits!" Quinn shouts as he ducks, spinning around loosing his shuriken back towards the sun. A painful short painful scream rings out into the still air before his blade teleports back to his hand. Emerging from over the hill, a group of bandits charge forward and two archers advance before kneeling and loosing two arrows which again fly wide of Quinn and Leshanna.

}}

Quinn, again, throwing out his blade deftly, he hits one of the archers, as an arrow sails by his own face, drawing blood. The rest of the rabble charge forward, splitting into two groups, trying to club the two adventurers into submission. Quinn side steps one blow before awkwardly parrying the second and almost loses his footing. Leshanna dodges the arrow fired at her as she ducks under a swing and rolls out of the way of a second. Shifting back a few paces, she summons forth lightning to her staff and shoots out three bolts. One bolt flies wide of its intended target, while the other two connect with the archers.

}}

Quinn, nearly surrounded, tumbles forward and kicks up dirt, blinding the bandits around him. He quickly swipes with his sword, cutting into all of them. The nearby archer screams in pain and falls back to the ground while the three rabble collapse to the ground lifelessly. One of the rabble rushes forward, swinging at Leshanna, while her armor still sparks with lightning from her cast and is shocked to death as he hits her. Another arrow shoots past her, wide left this time as the other two remaining rabble charge forward and have their attacks expertly parried and dodged.

Combat ends.
}}

Quinn, now free to engage the other archer quickly closes in on his unsuspecting opponent, cutting into their back with a sly flourish and they too fall to his blade. The remaining bandits quickly drop their weapons and raise their arms, surrendering. "You okay?" Quinn calls out to Leshanna.

"Yes, and you?"

"Yeah." Turning his attention to the three bandits, "How many others are there?"

"None," they all say in unison and nervously.

{{note
**Quinn, Leshanna:** :: Passive Insight 19; You get the sense that they are being truthful.
}}

"How many merchants did you hit today?"

{{note
**Quinn, Diplomacy vs Will:** :: 20 vs 14 - Pass.
}}

"You'd be the fourth," one of them says, and the other two give him a dirty look. "Screw it, I want to live. We thought you were simple travelers and could score some quick coin, didn't know you knew how to fight. He was the leader," the bandit says gesturing to the dead archer at Quinn's feet. Quinn wipes his blade clean on the corpse.

"What did you take?"

"Only coin, wanted to stay mobile for the day."

Quinn gets the rope out of his pack and binds the hands of each bandit behind their back and kicks their weapons away before signaling for Leshanna to follow him. "I would recommend against doing anything else stupid," he says dryly, gesturing to the other corpses nearby.  The two walk some distance away before Quinn looks back at the bandits and talks in a low voice "What do you want to do? We could turn in them in, but then we'd have to backtrack and they might not like the idea."

"I'm not fond of killing them after they have surrendered either," Leshanna says, matching Quinn's quiet volume. "Logically that leaves turning them loose but they know where we intended to set up camp..."

"If only it were earlier in the day," Quinn briefly looks back to the setting sun before returning his gaze to the bandits. "Hopefully they're sufficiently afraid and their desire to live is stronger than their stupidity..." He sighs as Leshanna begins walking back towards the bandits.

"Alright, listen up. You made one smart decision today, now you have the chance to make another one. Lucky for you, we're not fond of killing people after they surrender, and even more so, we don't want to deal with the hassle of escorting you back to the city. So, we're going to set you free, and what you choose to do from there is entirely up to you, but I'd strongly advise you to think before you act. You get to keep whatever is on you, but I'd like to think we'll never cross paths like this again." Quinn says diplomatically before walking back behind the bandits and unties the rope.

{{note
**Quinn, Diplomacy:** :: 17+7 - Pass.
}}

Quinn looks towards the archer, who spoke earlier, "And if you happen to have a change of heart about the line of work you're in, head back to Cadun and seek out [[Cirog]]. He's with the city guard, tell him that Quinn sent you and you're looking to start anew and he'll help you adjust." The archer nods, grabs his bow and quickly departs southward. The other two grab their clubs and run off to the east.

"You know, its dangerous going around telling people your name," Leshanna gestures to the two running east, "especially if they want pay back."

\page

"Given how things went the first time, I'm not too worried about those two... but you do have a point. At least I didn't say your name," Quinn responds as he grabs his pack, "well, now we need to find a new spot.. maybe back on the other side of the hill?"

Leshanna nods as she finishes searching the bandit corpses, shaking 4 bags of coin, "Guess it wasn't the best day for them in multiple ways."

The two cross back over the hill and move some distance towards the road before setting up camp for the night, opting to avoid the attention a fire would bring. Leshanna takes the first watch as Quinn sleeps before waking him for his.

### Summary

{{quote
*Malvan Crowsworn*, with much effort, convinces *Quinn Harcey* and *Leshanna Wynwarin* to let him join them on their quest. He quickly proves his sincerity by warning them of an impending ambush by bandits and assists the two in dispatching their foes. Concerned by the relatively sudden revenge, Quinn asks Malvan for more detail about the bandit gang and they conclude that they have upset the **Iron Circle**. While searching the bodies for two familiar faces, they are ambushed by a gnoll and two heynas. Quinn is knocked unconscious (first PC death save) but is stabilized. The three venture onwards, uneventfully, into the forest and make camp.

}}

The night passes uneventfully for the two adventurers that decide to eat a cold breakfast before breaking camp at sunrise. Unfortunately though, the heat of yesterday's sparse sky seems to have stuck around through the night making an unusually warm spring morning. Quinn and Leshanna both remove their chest armor begrudgingly in an attempt to stave off the heat and sweat for as long as possible. The two set off at 1.5 time pace, attempting to use their proximity to fresh water to their advantage, knowing they'll need to replenish soon and often.

**A:** :: Yes and... Keywords: Tedious, Shame, Adventurers

}}

Taking a short rest every two hours to drink and catch their breath, they make progress about the lake until reaching the northern end and get ready to set off northward at a normal pace. Just as they're about to set off, they hear a "Wait for me!" and turn around bewildered. They see a humanoid figure running up the road towards them, waving an arm. Unsure what to expect, Quinn rests his hand on his sword and Leshanna takes a step back and readies her staff. As the figure gets closer the two notice that something seems familiar about them but they can't quite place it. Panting, sweating, and out of breath, the man comes to a halt near the two, "Wait... just... a.. second..."

"Hold on, you're the archer from last night!" Quinn exclaims as he draws his blade. "What is it you want?"

"I.. want..." the man holds up a hand to signal to give him a chance to catch his breath. After a few moments, he regains his composure, "I want to join you. I was thinking about last night and went to see Cirog, but figured you're already on a job and the best time to start is now. I've been trying to catch up to you two all morning but this heat is just something else..."

Quinn looks at Leshanna and sheaths his blade, speaking in elvish "Great... more complications."

"I swear on my word, I'll cause you no trouble."

"Forgive us for doubting you, but you did try to kill or rob us last night."

"True, but you spared my life and I owe you for that. I am a skilled ranger and know this area quite well."

"And how do we know you don't already have a bounty on your head."

"You don't, but I don't. I mean, I was strong armed into recently joining the crew, last night was my first 'job' beyond watching the gear. I realize I have nothing to prove the sincerity of my word, but all I'm asking for is a chance, the same chance you offered me last night."

Quinn groans and looks towards Leshanna who replies in elvish, "You did tell him to make smarter decisions, but trust needs to be earned."

\page

The man holds up his hand to politely interrupt, also in elvish, "Apologies, but I figure its best that you know I'm a half-elf. In the interest of building trust." The two look a bit surprised and examine the man more closely. Now that they knew what they were looking for, the tell-tale signs were present: the ageless visage, the slender and tall physique, and even the slightly pointed ears.

"I appreciate the heart, but we're on a time sensitive mission and can't afford the distraction. Cirog really is your best bet if you're sincere about turning things around," Quinn replies.

The man slumps slightly, looking defeated, before straightening up again, "Just one day. That's all I ask, I can prove my sincerity. The day is already hot and its just going to get worse but I know where we can find fresh water along the road north that not many are aware of. There's a stream that feeds into this lake about 150 ft west of the road about 3 hours ahead."

Quinn thinks for a moment before looking to Leshanna, "He does have a point."

"One day." Leshanna says to the man.

"Thank you, and the name is Malvan, Malvan Crowsworn." He says smiling as he walks up to join the two, "Would you prefer I stay back or take the lead?"

"For the day, we'll be on the road, so lead away Malvan. I am Quinn and this Leshanna."

"One of these days you're going to learn to stop giving everyone our names," says Leshanna, playfully poking Quinn.The ranger hides a smile as he takes the lead, walking 20 paces ahead of the other two.

### Southern Outskirts, Chuddli Forest

Two hours into the journey, the three stop for another water break under a lone tree off the side of the road. Quinn shakes his head as he drinks from his waterskin, "His enthusiasm is infectious, we covered more ground in the past two hours than we did by ourselves."

"Maybe he's forcing you to take bigger strides," Leshanna jests. Malvan lets out a small chuckle, wiping his brow.

"I'm going to go scout ahead a little bit. Call it eagerness to prove myself, but I don't like being so open with the hill up ahead," Malvan says, turning to face the two.

"Knock yourself out," Quinn replies, making a mock toast with his waterskin. The ranger breaks off from the tree, staying off the road and deftly moves towards the crest of the hill, only slowing in stride as he nears the top.

"I think I might almost miss him," Quinn says with a smile before taking another swig. Suddenly, the ranger drops to a crouch before quickly turning around and heading back. Quinn's gut twists as Leshanna looks back to see Malvan. An arrow comes sailing over the hill and lands 60 feet away from the tree. Quinn and Leshanna immediately stop relaxing and begin putting on their armor from their packs, getting only halfway done by the time Malvan returns.

"Bandits. More from the crew. 3 Archers, 3 bruisers, and 7 rabble." Malvan says quickly, dropping his back and grabbing his quiver. "They should be cresting in a few moments."

"How do we know this isn't a trap?" Quinn asks dryly as he finishes putting on his leather armor and draws his shuriken. "Damn, we're too far for me to get a good shot."

"Because I'm not that stupid. I wouldn't risk getting this close to you if I wanted revenge."

"Fair enough." Leshanna says fixing the belt to hold her chain mail in place.

"I'll cover you, press up," the ranger says, knocking an arrow in his longbow and drawing it. A moment later a figure crests the hill and Malvan looses his arrow with deadly aim. "Make that 6 rabble. Now is not the time to question."

"Fair enough," Quinn replies, staying low but rushing towards the hill with Leshanna close behind. Two more arrows sail over their heads landing fair behind them. Malvan knocks another arrow and runs forward a bit, not to be left behind. Leshanna is first to crest the hill, her stride carrying her faster than Quinn's. She quickly confirms what Malvan said to be true and raises her staff as it glows a deep blue and releases a powerful invocation.

Leshanna limps back over the hill towards the tree while Malvan and Quinn search the bodies for anything of interest. On the Bersker's back is a Duelist's lightblade of +2. Malvan finds 550 gp in total. After a few moments, all three group back up at the tree.

"Well, any life-debt you feel like you owed, I think is repaid." Quinn says, taking a big swig of water. Leshanna nods in agreement as she finishes bandaging herself up. Malvan smiles and follows Quinn's lead in taking a big sip of water before taking off his armor. 

"I guess my former crew was bigger than they let on, but kinda makes sense in hindsight. It doesn't change anything as far as I'm concerned, but we may have made some powerful enemies."

"Do you know who they are? like did the crew have a name they went by?"

**A:** ::Yes.

"They didn't say it out right, but the outpost had a very prominent iron circle displayed. So, either they are playing a dangerous game, or the Iron Circle is going to be a thorn for a long while."

"That'd explain the magic weaponry and coordination in tactics. More coordinated than your typical roadside highway men."

Leshanna gives Quinn a look, "I'm not going to say it, but we need to get word to Cirog."

"We need to check for your two acquaintances amongst the dead again." Quinn says, looking at Malvan. The three finish recovering from the heat before searching the corpses for familiar faces.

An arrow thuds into a corpse next to Malvan, breaking the uneasy silence alongside two howls. The three turn towards the noise and see a gnoll with two heynas charging towards them. Dropping their gear, the three ready their weapons.

Malvan props Quinn up so that Leshanna can administer a healing potion to Quinn, and he comes to a few moments later. "W-what happened?"

"You tried to die on us." Malvan replies, "Took a good hit from the Gnoll's handaxe."

Quinn shakes his head, disoriented as the healing potion finishes taking effect. "Ugh.. I'm really not liking this heat today..."

"Agreed, we shouldn't stay too much longer, else we find its companions."

{{note
**Q:** :: Are the other two bandits present?
**A:** :: Yes
}}

Satisfied that the two other bandits from the night before are present, the three make their way back towards the road and continue northward. "I think its implied at this point you can come with us, assuming you still want to." Quinn says to Malvan. "Fair warning, its going to be more of what just happened."

"Understood, but that doesn't change anything - I mean, if I'm to be sincere to my word. Besides, I seem to be coming out of these scraps better than either of you." he responds in a light-hearted jest.

The three reach the edge of the forest as the sun begins to set, making use of Malvan's knowledge to wash off the heat and refill their waterskins. "Know of any good spots to camp, preferably unnoticed?"

\page

{{note
**Q:** :: Does Malvan's knowledge help in setting up camp?
**A:** :: Yes
}}

Malvan nods and leads the other two off the road a bit as Quinn works to mask their trail. About an hour later, Malvan signals that they've arrived and the three fan out, searching for any issues before returning to set up camp. Leshanna leaves to grab some timber as Malvan and Quinn dig two holes for the subdued fire. The hot air sticks around, even as the sun sets, and Malvan gets to know Leshanna and Quinn more.

"So, are you just adventurers for hire or is there something more?"

"We're actually with the Delver's of Zaban on a mission to verify rumors of goblin raiders in the forest. Supposedly they're making camp at an abandoned monastery a few more days worth of travel into the forest."

"Ah, I've only heard of the Delver's in passing, what is it you actually do?"

Quinn looks to Leshanna, "That's a great question I don't have the words for.."

"In a simple sense, Quinn is an adventurer for hire and he assists me on missions given by the order. I am a Seeker, a devout follower of Zaban, and its my mission to find knowledge for the order. In this case, the answer to the rumors is the knowledge I seek, as well as information about this monastery, as we don't have any on it."

"I see... And what does it take to join this order? I'm just exploring my options as I don''t want to wear out my welcome by being a lost puppy for too long.."

"Its been so long.. but I think if memory serves, Leshanna ran into me while on a mission and requested my services?" Quinn asks looking to Leshanna.

"Its only been 3 years, have you already forgotten? But yes, that's the gist. And then you came with me to report the conclusion and Tannyll asked if you'd be interested in continuing to work for the order." 

"Well, to be fair, its been a rather busy three years..." Quinn says smiling. "Well, as the new guy, I hope you don't mind second watch.."

"Fair is fair, I typically wake up rather easily anyways."

"Good because I don't, which is why I take last watch."

{{note
**Q:** :: Is there an encounter tonight?
**A:** :: No

The evening passes quietly into morning as the three rotate between watching and sleeping.

### Southern Outskirts, Chuddli Forest

{{note
- Weather Check: Spring, 74 - Clear Skies
}}

The hot air from yesterday threatens to lurk into the next before the clear skies of the night rapid drop the temperature and the morning begins a characteristically cool for spring. Quietly and efficiently, the three break camp and make their way back towards the road.


{{note
**Q:** :: Is there an encounter?
**A:** :: Yes, the foliage suddenly becomes lush and thick in this area. It is a little out of place, and seems to have sprung up unnaturally, as if the result of some kind of natural magic.

Malvan slows his pace, until the other two catch up. In whispers, they ask "What is it? Trouble?" He nods in response but points ahead to a growth across the road.

"That shouldn't be here, I was just here less than an elevenday and it was a clear road..." Malvan's voice trails off.

"What, the plants?" Quinn asks confused.

"Yes. I'm telling you, the road meeting up with the north east path to Tardy had nothing like this."

"Give me a moment." Leshanna says, closes her eyes and stretching out her hand.

"Its some sort of restorative enchantment, fairly powerful." The growth grows towards the three.

"Uh... did anyone else just see it grow closer?" Quinn asks. Leshanna looks at him bewildered before Malvan agrees.

"We can cut either west or east, but I'd advise going through it." Leshanna says flatly.

"West," Malvan responds in kind.

The three start walking west as the growth grows further down the road, seemingly in a burst every few seconds.

"We might want to go a bit south too..." Quinn says uneasy, "...And there's another problem, it doesn't stand 

\page

out as much in the wood as it does on the road.."

"I can still sense it and should be able to guide us around it. Malvan, keep track of how far we stray from the road."

"Got it."

"Does anyone else hear the singing, or am I just going crazy now?" Quinn asks. 

"No.. I hear it too..."

"Agreed.."

"Great... now what?"

"Let me think.." Leshanna pauses and closes her eyes, trying to recall information about the forest. Quinn, shaking off his nerves gets a similar idea.

"If memory serves, that's a dryad singing, and it'd explain the powerful nature magic at work," Leshanna says.

"We've also been tracking the growth of the forest southward at an increasing rate, fare beyond what we'd normally expect, over the past couple of decades," Quinn adds.

"So where does that put us?" Malvan asks, "I mean we could go directly east until we hit the other road, and go around, but that'd add at least a day to the trip, if not more. So, we know what's causing it, what do we do? fight it? run from it? parley with it?" His voice gets less confident with each question. Quinn and Leshanna share a look.

"Well, that is an interesting point. We've done no harm to the forest, we might be able to explain our purpose and be granted safe passage." Leshanna replies, "I mean, I do share a kin-ship with the forest and dryads as a Fae-elf..."

Quinn looks to Leshanna, "I mean, its your call, you'd be the one doing most, if not all of the talking..."

"I think we're out of time," Malvan says with an outstretched hand, pointing at a beautiful fae-elf walking towards them as the singing grows louder. Leshanna takes a deep breath and looks to the other two, "Don't reach for your weapons unless it is absolutely clear we have no choice. We might not even win this if it comes to that... So, let's not give any reason for hostility, shall we?"

Quinn forces himself to fight his urge to have his hand on his sword and Malvan shifts uncomfortably before taking a few deep breaths. He notes the smell of sweet flowers that wasn't there before.

"Hail sacred guardian of the glade, we do not seek to trespass unwaranted." Leshanna calls out. The dryad stops, stares for a moment, the beautiful singing stopping.

"Then why are you here?"

{{note

"We seek an old monastery. There are rumors of goblins using it as their raiding camp, we desire nothing more than to see if it is true, and expunge them if so."

"That maybe true, but you are still trespassing on a sacred glade."

"Forgive us, for if we knew so, we wouldn't. Our history mentions nothing of the glade, and so we have mistakenly stepped where we shouldn't." Quinn quickly undoes his belt, letting his sword and shuriken pouch drop to the ground and holds his hands up. Malvan quickly follows suit, first dropping his quiver then unslinging and tossing his bow gently to the ground.

{{note
> **Leshanna** *Diplomacy*: 21. <br>
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1. (-1)
}}

"Your companions discard their weapons but you do not, why?"

"Because we share a kindred spirit, we are both of the fae. I know that you will not attack unprovoked, just as I will not. We have done nothing but tell the truth to your ears."

{{note
> **Dryad** *Insight*: 24.
}}

The dryad pauses for a moment, thinking about the words Leshanna has said.

"I will grant you safe passage on one condition: bring me the heads of these goblins who dare defile the grove."

In elvish, Quinn pipes up, "Forgive my intrusion, but we only have a few traveler's word that there may be goblins, we don't know for sure. What if we don't find any?"

{{note
> **Quinn** *Diplomacy*: 14. <br>
> **Dryad** weariness remains unchanged. (-1)
}}

The dryad snaps to look at Quinn, be eases a bit as he speaks in moderately decent fae-elvish. "We will deal with it upon your return. If you have been as truthful as you claim, then you have no cause for concern."

Leshanna looks back at Quinn, then Malvan who then takes his turn to speak, "Oh beautiful protector, if I may, my companions are unsure of this monastery's existence, is there aught you can tell us about it? The quicker we find it, the quicker we will no longer be in your grove."

\page

{{note
> **Malvan** *Diplomacy*: 23. <br>
> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1, she is now neutral with the party. (0)
}}

The dryad looks to Leshanna before looking back to Malvan, "You would be wise to ask your fae companion the dangers of asking favors of the fae." She inhales and exhales deeply, a fresh wave of floral scent washing over the party. "I can do better than tell, but you will have to pay the kindness in kind."

Malvan looks between Quinn and Leshanna, "Well? I mean, the fewer days in the grove the better from where I stand." He shifts nervously.

Leshanna sighs and thinks for a moment before turning back to the dryad, "What would it be that you would ask of us?"

She smiles politely, "tell their people this road belongs to the forest now. They may still have the other path, but the northwest belongs to the grove."

"We can relay your message, but cannot promise that all will heed the warning."

"The warning is sufficient, the fools will be fools."

Quinn looks between his companions, "Well, the only others I know of on this fork besides us are nothing but trouble, so I think it might be a fair trade.."

Leshanna sighs, "Tannyll is not going to like this, but then again, we now know why the forest has been growing so much." She looks back to Malvan before the dryad, "Very well, I, Leshanna Wynwarin, pledge to follow our end of the bargain. What is yours?"

"I will take you to your obsidian monastery, the glade need not be disturbed. Grab your weapons, lest you leave them behind." She addresses Quinn and Malvan. The two quickly resecure their arms before stepping forward, up to Leshanna. The dryad gestures to a tree near the three of them, and suddenly the bark folds in on itself creating a hole glowing with brilliant primal energy. "This tree will take you half a day away from your destination. Head due north, that is, unless you'd like to be closer."

"Half-a-day journey is more than kind enough," Leshanna quickly cuts in, "Oh.. we didn't catch your name protector?"

{{note

> **Dryad** weariness decreases by 1. (+1)
}}

"Megara," she smiles, "go quickly, the portal will not stay open for long. And remember, the grove is watching carefully." Quinn and Malvan quickly follow in Leshanna's brisk footsteps, noding to the dryad before touching the tree and being sucked into darkness. A few moments later, their vision clears, and they find themselves in a completely different wood. The tree they have laid their hands on seems to be the only healthy one in sight.

### Deep, Chuddli Forest

The three quickly fan out and search their surroundings for a few moments before regrouping. "Well, that's quite handy." Quinn says in an upbeat tone.

"I just hope the Readings of Zaban will be more pleased with what we find than what we promised," Leshanna says neutrally.

"What? tell people not to travel an old road that is really only used by bandits and the like?" Malvan cuts in

"Worse is if the monastery is of interest other than an old worn down building, we just denied any further travel to it for the foreseeable future."

"Well, we'll just have to make sure we leave no secret behind then," Quinn responds with a smile. "Also, did I hear that right? obsidian monastery?"

"You did. Isn't that what Aenbulf said?"

"Right.. he was saying..it was made of slate obsidian not native to the region and that it was constructed at a great place of power in celebration to someone he doesn't remember the name of."

Leshanna looks around, "the state of the grove here has me worried about that last bit. Look, everything else is in some state of decay or already dead."

"Then we best not stay long."

The other two nod before resuming their traveling formation, with Malvan up front and Quinn and Leshanna flanking. Malvan pauses for a moment, looking around, as if he's being watched but doesn't see anything out of the ordinary. He tries to shake it off, but the feeling persists and he grumbles to himself for a moment before the three continue onwards. Quinn lets out a soft whistle and points up, noting that even the clear skies from the early morning have taken on a weird tint, almost like a shade of black permeates the area they now walk.

Making relatively cautious but strong progress, its only a few hours before the party catches the glimpse of hard rigid lines between the trees. Malvan signals and the other two halt, and all three listen intently to their surroundings. Normally the lack of wildlife noises would be cause for concern, but its been that way for the past few hours.
