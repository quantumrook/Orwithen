### North of Cadun, Unnamed Lake

The sun begins to rise after an uneventful night ends, and the three quickly break camp, eager to get back to Cadun.

The party makes excellent progress for the first half of the day, running into nothing on the open road. As the sun nears its zenith however, Gadriel and Aniel rise from the west, heading to meet the sun. Malvan points to the sky during their lunch break and asks, "We're not due for an eclipse, are we?"

Leshanna looks to where he's pointing and see's the path, growing worried, "No... No, we're not, not for another 5 elevendays..." Her voice trails off as she quickly finishes her rations. Quinn and Malvan follow suit.

"I get the sense that I don't want to be on the road when this happens but then again, I don't know where a good place would be..." Quinn says also growing concerned. The three hit the road at a moderately fast pace, just under jogging and keep glancing up to the sky. Just past the zenith, at the thirteenth hour, the moons cross over the sun from either side. As the sky starts to darken, Leshanna feels a wave of nausea wash over her and she struggles to remain standing. Malvan is hit with a much milder effect as the ambient magic currents swell and subside. A few moments later, Quinn struggles to stand as the ground shakes beneath him, and Leshanna falls over. Malvan manages to catch himself and he shakily moves towards Leshanna to help her up. The moons finish crossing each other and the sun and Leshanna and Malvan are hit with a milder wave of nausea as the magical aftershock hits them.

"What in the gods names was that?" Quinn asks, shaking his head as he regains his own balance.

Leshanna stays hunched over, trying to regain control of her body as Malvan tries to answer, "Something powerful... and magical.. enough for even me to sense it."

After a few moments, the party regains their senses and Leshanna confirms Malvan's suspicion. "Definitely magical, definitely powerful." Leshanna rubs her temples, trying to suppress a headache, "We should hurry back to Cadun." The other two nod and the party starts off at an uneasy pace. Continued glances up to the sky are met with a feeling of reassurance, as the moons drift further back to their normal positions, and Leshanna begins to look more and more like herself.
