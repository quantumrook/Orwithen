A collection of adventurers and followers of [[Zaban]], that seek knowledge in the interest of sharing it with all.

## Hierarchy

1. Headmaster
2. Head-librarian
3. Librarian
4. Seeker
5. Delver

The Headmaster resides in [[Hellonde, the City of Oaths]] where the original temple to Zaban is located. Head-Librarians serve as the local leader for each sect and also as the administrator of the temple/library where they reside. They often live onsite in chambers provided for them by the order. Librarians serve as their name sake and also as the managers of Seekers and Delvers, dispatching them on quests that pique the order's interest. Seekers follow the teachings of Zaban and often invoke her name in divine incantations, and as a result are typically Paladins, Clerics, Invokers, or Avengers. Delver's are adventures whose interests align with the orders for a myriad of reasons, and offer their services to the order in exchange for access to the library or adventure.
