Alignment: Evil

Owner of the forgotten month of Winter by the same name, he is not openly worshiped in most cultures. Keeper of secrets and magic, he grew thirsty for more power, threatening Zaban's domain before the other six stepped in to cast him down during the [[Calamity]]. While he is no longer in the pantheon, his domain remains and has grown in power over the recent centuries, most notable in the 900s.
